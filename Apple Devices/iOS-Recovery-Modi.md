# iOS Recovery Modi

In order to effectively troubleshoot and restore various iOS devices, it is important to have clear documentation outlining 
the necessary steps to put each device into its respective recovery mode. 
As such, this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) has been created as a reference guide 
to quickly and easily access the instructions for placing different iOS devices in recovery mode.

## Recovery Mode
iOS Recovery Mode is a mode that allows the device to be restored with the latest version of iOS, without the need for an iTunes backup. 
It can be used in cases where the device is stuck on the Apple logo, in a continuous restart loop or is not responding. 
To put an iOS device in Recovery Mode, you need to connect it to a computer with iTunes installed, and then follow a specific set of button presses to activate the mode.

## DFU Mode
DFU (Device Firmware Update) mode, is a mode that allows the device to be restored with custom firmware. 
This mode is used when the device is completely unresponsive, or when you want to downgrade to an earlier version of iOS. 
DFU mode allows the device to be restored even if the software is corrupt or damaged. 
To put an iOS device in DFU mode, you need to connect it to a computer with iTunes installed, and then follow a specific set of button presses to activate the mode.

## Difference between DFU Mode and Recovery Mode
iOS Recovery Mode and DFU Mode are both special modes that are used to troubleshoot, restore or update iOS devices like iPhones, iPads and iPods. 
Although they serve similar purposes, there are some differences between the two:

The main difference between Recovery Mode and DFU Mode is the level of control they provide over the device. 
In Recovery Mode, the device still has access to the bootloader, which means that the firmware can be restored or updated. 
In DFU mode, however, the device bypasses the bootloader and allows the firmware to be directly manipulated.  

In summary, Recovery Mode is used to restore the latest version of iOS to the device, 
while DFU Mode is used to restore custom firmware or to downgrade to an earlier version of iOS. 
The main difference between the two is the level of control they provide over the device.
